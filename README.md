# Devops and Microservices course
In this course project. I intend to take my car calculator project to the next level, 
and build a website containing my own vehicle trading system. 
## Goals 
1. **Make a login system using Flask**
2. **Make a microservice, which can download car information**
3. **Make different microservices, that builds models of the car database** 
    3. A regression model to predict prices of a car
    3. A plotter of that model, and all new vehicles position in it
4. **Make a graphical user interface**

        The user interface should be created dependant on which models the user is subscribed too. 
## TODO  
* Given the curent state the Flask tutorial shoud be completed so we have the user login functionality. 

## Current state 
1. Started setting up a flask server which I should develop into my simple website.
